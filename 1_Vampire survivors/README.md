# Vampire Survivors

This game is inspired by Vampire Survivors: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/


It is a rouge-like bullet hell game where you control a character that automatically attacks enemies. You can move around the map, collect experience orbs, and upgrade your character with various items and abilities.

# My version

This version is a simplified version of the original game.
You can play the game by running the `main.py` file.

The `train.py` file can be used to train a reinforcement learning agent to play the game.

The `inference.py` file can be used to run the trained agent in the game.

The initial game was coded in the repo: https://github.com/Arjun-G-Ravi/Noob-projects/tree/main/25_VampireSurvivorsGame
